TODO
create transition time based on acceleration
[IN PROGRESS] create states for game logic like on_ground_all_moves and in_air_all_moves, in_air_movement
[IN PROGRESS] create timer for controls so you have to  tap right + attack to kick
magnetize movement so you move in place for the attack
maybe rework jumping/movement so it's smaller?
make character stats
seperate states that handle animations and states that handle movement (in_air, on_surface, and tweens)
make it so you can't stand up while ducking under something

wanted animations
tap down + attack = swipe

KNOWN ISSUES
USB Apple keyboard does not register all keys when you press down + right + n ???
Crashes on windows 8?
Stage reset while running doesn't stop run sound loop
Some issues with movement and hit testing, refactor please
If I don't round the hitbox height I start 'falling' while sizing the hitbox down (eg StandToDuck)
